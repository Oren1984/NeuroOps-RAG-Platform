# NeuroOps – RAG Platform - Local Verification Summary

**Date:** 2026-02-03  
**Verification Type:** LOCAL-ONLY (No Cloud Deployment)  
**Status:** ✅ ALL TASKS COMPLETED

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully completed comprehensive local verification of NeuroOps – RAG Platform. All systems operational, configurations fixed, and documentation generated. The application runs in safe stub mode without requiring real LLM API keys.

---

## Tasks Completed

### ✅ 1. Repo Quick Audit
**Status:** PASSED  
**Issues Found & Fixed:**
- ❌ **PG_DSN default in settings.py** used `127.0.0.1` (incorrect for Docker)
  - **Fixed:** Changed to `db` host for Docker network compatibility
- ❌ **Docker image** used `postgres:16` (missing vector extension)
  - **Fixed:** Changed to `pgvector/pgvector:pg16`

**Configuration Verification:**
- ✅ docker-compose.yml has proper healthcheck and depends_on
- ✅ Observability stack (Phoenix + OTel) properly configured
- ✅ .env file exists with test API key
- ✅ All key files present and valid

---

### ✅ 2. Local Build + Run (Docker)
**Status:** PASSED  

**Build Results:**
```
docker compose build --no-cache  → SUCCESS (42.7s)
docker compose up -d             → SUCCESS
```

**Container Status:**
```
rag-agent-kit-api-1   Running   127.0.0.1:8000->8000/tcp
rag-agent-kit-db-1    Healthy   127.0.0.1:5432->5432/tcp
```

**Key Achievements:**
- Docker Desktop started successfully
- Image built with all dependencies (FastAPI, pgvector, etc.)
- Both containers started without errors
- Database initialized with vector extension
- API started in stub mode (no real LLM keys needed)

---

### ✅ 3. Health Verification
**Status:** PASSED  
**Report:** [reports/local_smoke_test.md](reports/local_smoke_test.md)

**Endpoints Tested:**
| Endpoint | Method | Auth | Status | Result |
|----------|--------|------|--------|--------|
| `/health` | GET | No | 200 | ✅ OK |
| `/ready` | GET | No | 200 | ✅ OK |
| `/docs` | GET | No | 200 | ✅ OK |
| `/ask` | POST | Yes | 200 | ✅ OK (stub mode) |

**Security Validation:**
- ✅ API key authentication enforced
- ✅ Unauthorized requests properly rejected (401)
- ✅ Stub mode prevents accidental API calls

---

### ✅ 4. Observability (Phoenix + OTel)
**Status:** PARTIAL - Infrastructure Ready  
**Report:** [reports/observability_check.md](reports/observability_check.md)

**Infrastructure Status:**
```
observability-phoenix-1   Running   0.0.0.0:6006->6006/tcp
observability-otel-1      Running   0.0.0.0:4318->4318/tcp
```

**Verified:**
- ✅ Phoenix UI accessible at http://127.0.0.1:6006
- ✅ OTel Collector running and ready
- ✅ Network connectivity between services
- ✅ Configuration files valid

**Limitation:**
- ⚠️ API not instrumented with OpenTelemetry (intentional - no new features)
- 📝 Detailed instrumentation guide provided in report

---

### ✅ 5. Tests Execution
**Status:** PASSED  
**Report:** [reports/test_output.txt](reports/test_output.txt)

**Smoke Test Results:**
```
Testing /health endpoint...               [OK]
Testing /ready endpoint...                [OK]
Testing /ask without API key...           [OK]
Testing /ask with valid API key...        [OK]

Results: 4 passed, 0 failed
```

**Test Infrastructure:**
- Created `tests/smoke_test.py` (no pytest dependency)
- Tests all critical endpoints
- Validates authentication
- Works in CI and local environments

---

### ✅ 6. Clean Shutdown Check
**Status:** PASSED  
**Report:** [reports/cleanup_notes.md](reports/cleanup_notes.md)

**Shutdown Results:**
- ✅ All containers stopped gracefully
- ✅ Networks removed successfully
- ✅ Database volume persisted (data safe)
- ✅ No orphaned containers

**Commands Verified:**
```bash
docker compose down                                      # Main stack
docker compose -f observability/docker-compose.phoenix.yml down  # Observability
docker volume ls | Select-String "rag-agent-kit"         # Volume check
```

---

### ✅ 7. GitHub Actions CI
**Status:** UPDATED  
**File:** [.github/workflows/ci.yml](.github/workflows/ci.yml)

**Improvements Made:**
1. ✅ Added `workflow_dispatch` trigger (manual runs)
2. ✅ Updated smoke test path to `tests/smoke_test.py`
3. ✅ Added new `docker-build` job:
   - Builds Docker image
   - Starts containers with Docker Compose
   - Runs smoke tests against containerized API
   - Shows logs on failure
   - Cleans up volumes

**CI Jobs:**
- `test`: Python unit tests + pytest + smoke test
- `docker-build`: Full Docker integration test

**No Cloud Secrets Required:** ✅

4. **Document .env setup** more clearly in README

### 🚫 Boundaries Respected
- ✅ No Terraform apply/destroy executed
- ✅ No real API keys required
- ✅ No new product features added
